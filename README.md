To test the simulator, run the menu.py file. You will need python3 and pygame to run it. 

This should bring up a screen with three options to choose from. Click on the option you would like to run. The first two options are those which have AI implemented in them. After every round, statistics of the previous round will be brought up on the console so you can observe the improvement. You can also press 'P' to pause and unpause them at any moment during a round and see the combat q-table displayed.

If you would like to change anything in the code, I have put the main variables to change under comments in capital letters, such as the number of soldiers on each team, the q-learning equation variables, the amount of reward given, and the aggressive/random behavior in the fully observable environment.
